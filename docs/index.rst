ThriftPy2
========

ThriftPy2 is a pure python implementation of
`Apache Thrift <http://thrift.apache.org/>`_ in a pythonic way.

The official thrift python lib is not pythonic at all, it needs a complicated
process of installation, and the generated sdk is very ugly. Everytime the
thrift file changed you have to re-generate the sdk which causes more pain
in development.

ThriftPy2 helps that, it's compatible with Apache Thrift so you no longer need
to install 'thrift' package, it can import thrift file on the fly so you
no longer need to re-generate the sdk again and again and again.

Code Demo
=========

ThriftPy2 make it super easy to write server/client code with thrift. Let's
checkout this simple pingpong service demo.

We need a 'pingpong.thrift' file:

::

    service PingPong {
        string ping(),
    }

Then we can make a server:

.. code:: python

    import thriftpy2
    pingpong_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pingpong.thrift", module_name="pingpong_thrift")

    from thriftpy2.rpc import make_server

    class Dispatcher(object):
        def ping(self):
            return "pong"

    server = make_server(pingpong_thrift.PingPong, Dispatcher(), '127.0.0.1', 6000)
    server.serve()

And a client:

.. code:: python

    import thriftpy2
    pingpong_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pingpong.thrift", module_name="pingpong_thrift")

    from thriftpy2.rpc import make_client

    client = make_client(pingpong_thrift.PingPong, '127.0.0.1', 6000)
    client.ping()

See, it's that easy!

You can refer to 'examples' and 'tests' directory in source code for more
usage examples.



Features
========

Currently ThriftPy2 have these features (also advantages over the upstream
python lib):

- Supports Python 2.7, Python 3.4+, PyPy and PyPy3.

- Pure python implementation. No longer need to compile & install the 'thrift'
  package. All you need is thriftpy2 and thrift file.

- Compatible with Apache Thrift. You can use ThriftPy2 together with the
  official implementation servers and clients, such as a upstream server with
  a thriftpy2 client or the opposite.

  Currently implemented protocols and transports:

  * binary protocol (python and cython)

  * compact protocol (python and cython)

  * json protocol

  * buffered transport (python & cython)

  * framed transport

  * tornado server and client (with tornado 4.0)
- Can directly load thrift file as module, the sdk code will be generated on
  the fly.

  For example, ``pingpong_thrift = thriftpy2.load("pingpong.thrift", module_name="pingpong_thrift")``
  will load 'pingpong.thrift' as 'pingpong_thrift' module.

  Or, when import hook enabled by ``thriftpy2.install_import_hook()``, you can
  directly use ``import pingpong_thrift`` to import the 'pingpong.thrift' file
  as module, you may also use ``from pingpong_thrift import PingService`` to
  import specific object from the thrift module.

- Easy RPC server/client setup.



Installation
============

Install with pip.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install thriftpy2

You may also install cython first to build cython extension locally.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install cython thriftpy2


Usage Notice
============

Cython Binary Protocol
----------------------

The Cython accelerating binary protocol is enabled by default for CPython if it's
available, but disabled for PyPy.

To force use pure python version of binary protocol, you must import them from
the direct module.

.. code:: python

    from thriftpy2.protocol.binary import TBinaryProtocolFactory
    from thriftpy2.transport.buffered import TBufferedTransportFactory
    from thriftpy2.transport.framed import TFramedTransportFactory


Better Module
-------------

To load thrift file as better module, provide a `module_name` in `load`.

The direct loaded TObjects can't be pickled.

.. code:: python

    >>> ab = thriftpy2.load("addressbook.thrift")
    >>> pickle.dumps(ab.AddressBook())
    PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'addressbook.AddressBook'>

TObjects can be pickled when load with `module_name` provided.

.. code:: python

    >>> ab = thriftpy2.load("addressbook.thrift", "addressbook_thrift")
    >>> pickle.dumps(ab.AddressBook())
    b'\x80\x03caddressbook_thrift\nAddressBook\nq\x00)\x81q\x01}q\x02X\x06\x00\x00\x00peopleq\x03Nsb.'

You can also use `from ... import ...` style after a standard module load.

.. code:: python

    >>> ab = thriftpy2.load("addressbook.thrift", "addressbook_thrift")
    >>> from addressbook_thrift import *
